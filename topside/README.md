This is strictly for end-of-2024 MATE ROV competition use only! I have rewritten the ESP32 firmware to host a webserver, so no topside client will be required, meaning any computer, phone, or device can be used to control JENA the float.

As of 6/21/2024, the topside should no longer be needed, as the float product demonstrations have been completed.
